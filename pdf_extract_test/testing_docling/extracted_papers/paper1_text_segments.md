**5.** Although the field of neutrino astronomy has blossomed in the last decade, physicists have struggled to fully map the high-energy neutrino sky. TAMBO, a mountain-based neutrino observatory, aims to solve that issue-and find clues of new physics along the way.

### Introduction

**1.** Neutrino astronomy is flourishing. Its roots run at least half a century deep, to the 1960s, when high-energy neutrinos became associated with newly discovered cosmic phenomena, such as quasars, stellar collapse, and the cosmic microwave background. Although plans for a deep underwater neutrino detector had already formed in the 1970s [1], exploring the cosmos with neutrinos only became a reality in 2013, when the IceCube Neutrino Observatory discovered the first extra-galactic high-energy neutrinos-of petaelectrovolts (PeV) [2]. The field has evolved rapidly since.

**2.** In the last decade, the study of cosmic neutrinos has yielded significant insights into their potential sourcesfrom the Milky Way to active galactic nuclei-and moved the field closer to finding the long-sought origin of cosmic rays [3, 4]. It has furthermore enabled some of the most stringent tests of fundamental physics to date (e.g., Ref. [5]), along with providing hints of physics beyond the

**3.** However, despite these successes, there is still a severe lack of identified cosmic high-energy neutrino sources. Only three such sources have been identified with high significance: an active galactic nucleus, an active galaxy, and the Milky Way [7-9]. The neutrino flux from these sources makes up only a small fraction of the total observed cosmic neutrino flux, and the origin of most cosmic neutrinos hence remains unknown. Additionally, the discovery of the three known neutrino sources relied on the aid of gamma-ray observations [7, 8]. Neutrino sources uncorrelated with electromagnetic radiation might be abundant, yet searches for them have been unsuccessful.

**4.** An urgent demand thus exists to develop new techniques to discover neutrino sources more effectively, in particular ones that are unbiased toward having electromagnetic counterparts. Moreover, a push towards lowcost detectors would make the field more widely accessible, support its growth, and complement the groundbreaking yet costly efforts of IceCube [2], KM3NeT [10],

### Enter Tambo

**1.** the air, decays, and initiates an extensive air shower of particles that cross the expanse of the valley. TAMBO aims to observe these air showers by placing an array of particle detectors on one face of the valley, allowing it to monitor the opposite face and thus detect Earthskimming tau neutrinos that reach it from nearly horizontal directions-realizing an idea first introduced in 1999 [12].

**2.** TAMBO is designed to overcome the major challenge in identifying neutrino sources for existing experiments: the background of atmospheric neutrinos that is roughly a million times larger than cosmic neutrino signals. Unlike traditional neutrino telescopes, TAMBO is developed to be sensitive to higher-energy, supra-PeV tau neutrinos. At these high energies, the cosmic neutrino signal dominates over the atmospheric neutrino background, particularly for tau neutrinos. As a result, any neutrino detected by TAMBO is likely to be of cosmic origin.

**3.** The key to TAMBO's concept is the use of the topography of a deep valley (Figure 1). Upon reaching Earth, high-energy cosmic tau neutrinos ( ν τ ) can travel for up to hundreds of kilometers through the Earth's crust. Each ν τ has a chance to interact with the rock in the crust and produce a short-lived tau lepton, the probability of which increases with neutrino energy. If this occurs in the vicinity of a deep valley, the tau lepton exits into

**4.** TAMBO is set up to determine the direction of tau neutrinos with sub-degree angular resolution, which is a crucial requisite to search for neutrino point sources. In its nominal configuration, TAMBO comprises 5,000 detection units spaced 150 m apart on a triangular grid, to account for the footprint of a typical particle shower in a deep valley (i.e., hundreds of meters). From the number of particles incident on each detection unit and the times at which different units are hit, TAMBO infers the neutrino energy and direction. Figure 2 illustrates this setup and shows the simulated detection of a neutrino with about 8 PeV of energy.

**5.** *[Figure description: Figure 3 shows TAMBO's aperture, which is proportional to its sensitivity to the incoming neutrino f...]*

**6.** decay to tau leptons. Above 2PeV, the TAMBO aperture exceeds the IceCube ν τ aperture, which is limited by the requirement that showers be contained within the instrumented volume. Above 1EeV, the TAMBO aperture flattens because the boosted tau lifetime prevents it from decaying inside the valley.

**7.** In its nominal configuration, we expect TAMBO to observe, on average, 6 extragalactic neutrinos every ten years, assuming only the neutrino flux measured by IceCube in Ref. [13], and more than 20 in ten years in more optimistic scenarios [14]. While the overall number of detected neutrinos may be small compared to observatories such as IceCube, the cosmic purity of TAMBO's sample will be substantially higher: every neutrino detected by TAMBO will mark the observation of either a cosmic neutrino source or the discovery of the long-theorized cosmogenic neutrino flux. Beyond its own science goals (see below), TAMBO thus acts as a viewfinder for other neutrino telescopes worldwide: providing precise locations of likely neutrino sources to inspect more closely and overcoming the statistical penalties that weaken current fullsky and catalog source searches.

**8.** TAMBO furthermore benefits from a relatively low cost compared with traditional water- or ice-Cherenkov neutrino telescopes: its detection units are significantly cheaper and easier to deploy, as they do not require deep drilling in ice or deployment in the sea. We expect TAMBO's final price tag to be around 10% of that of IceCube. The performance of TAMBO scales with the number of detection units deployed, and partial goals are achievable even with a fraction of the array simulated here, making TAMBO resilient should funding become limited. Considering how strongly TAMBO will boost the capabilities of existing neutrino telescopes to study neutrino sources, we believe it could be their most costeffective enhancement.

**9.** Akey design challenge for TAMBO's detection concept is selecting an optimal geographic site that provides the required surface area and valley width. Several potential locations for TAMBO are currently under consideration for their technical, societal, and environmental suitability, with one strong possibility being the Colca Valley in the Peruvian Andes. Because mountain ecosystems are generally fragile and sites can have potential histories of foreign exploitation, our collaboration is spearheading a socially and environmentally responsible approach to the site selection procedure, inspired by similar discussions taking place in other areas of astronomy [15].

### Pev Neutrino Astrophysics

**1.** Discovering new astrophysical neutrino sourcesBelow ∼ 100 PeV, neutrinos observed by TAMBO will likely originate from inside cosmic accelerators, thus pointing to the locations of potential neutrino sources.

**2.** *[Figure description: FIG. 2. Simulation of neutrino detection in TAMBO. Each detection unit in the TAMBO array is marked ...]*

**3.** Following an observation by TAMBO, the potential source location can be promptly investigated by the existing larger-statistics, lower-purity neutrino telescopes (IceCube, KM3NeT, BaikalGVD) using their full archival datasets. This will substantially increase the sensitivity of these telescopes by reducing the size of the trials factor, compared to contemporary source-search techniques. With the lower threshold of these experiments, and given that the neutrino flux typically falls with neutrino energy, they will be capable of seeing many events from the TAMBO-discovered candidate source positions. This could lead to the first neutrino-only source discovery in astronomy, without relying on observations using light or light-based catalogs.

**4.** Searching for the diffuse cosmogenic neutrino fluxAbove ∼ 100 PeV, any neutrinos observed by TAMBO are more likely to have originated from a diffuse flux of cosmogenic neutrinos rather than from cosmic accelerators; these neutrinos are produced by ultra-highenergy protons scattering off the cosmic microwave background [16]. As such, TAMBO will provide crucial insights on models of cosmogenic neutrinos, helping to

**6.** explain the dearth of cosmic rays with energies above the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin limit, 5 × 10 19 eV [17, 18]. Our forecasts show that, after seven years of operation, TAMBO will be sensitive to optimistic cosmogenic neutrino flux models, such as that proposed by Bergman & van Vliet [19]. This sensitivity will also enable crucial new insight into KM3NeT's recent 220 PeV neutrino observation. The origin of this neutrino is currently unknown [20], and combined analyses with IceCube data have so far been inconclusive [21].

**7.** In addition to searching for the cosmogenic neutrino flux, TAMBO will expand upon IceCube's measurements [22] of the diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux, thought to originate from unresolved point sources. TAMBO extends these measurements above several PeV: between 1 PeV and 1 EeV, its projected sensitivity to this diffuse astrophysical flux exceeds that of all present-day observatories.

### Messengers Of Uncharted Physics

**1.** Searching for new particle phenomenaIn just over a decade, neutrino astrophysics has provided a wealth of tests of the Standard Model. Such tests include measuring the neutrino-nucleon cross section [23], probing neutrino interactions with dark matter [24], searching for sterile neutrinos [25], scrutinizing different neutrino mass mechanisms [26], testing fundamental symmetries [27], and setting limits on quantum gravity [28]. Despite this broad program, the strength of such tests degrades at ≳ PeV energies due to the dearth of neutrinos detected at these energies.

**2.** TAMBO will extend these tests to energies above a few PeV while also enabling new tests of physics beyond the Standard Model by taking advantage of its ν τ exclusivity. The ν τ is the least-observed Standard Model particle, and thus there are considerable opportunities to discover or constrain new physics associated with it. Of particular interest is TAMBO's ability to further constrain the cosmic neutrino flux's flavor composition by combining its data with that of IceCube. Because the flavor composition is a particularly versatile probe of new physics [29], such a measurement would inform multiple new-physics models.

**3.** Understanding hadronic models and cosmic-ray physicsBecause of its location in a valley, TAMBO will also uniquely contribute to understanding cosmic rays and their associated air showers, complementing existing experiments such as IceTop [30] and the Pierre Auger Observatory [31].

**4.** In particular, TAMBO has significant potential to address the cosmic-ray muon puzzle : the persistent underprediction of the average number of muons by airshower simulations, despite correctly predicting other shower properties [32]. Leveraging its high-altitude location, inclined geometry, and natural geological features, TAMBO could utilize surrounding rock formations to selectively shield the electromagnetic component of air showers. This approach would enable simultaneous measurements of electromagnetic and muonic components, offering a new perspective on air shower physics at energies where discrepancies in muon predictions become evident. Resolving the muon puzzle will directly impact neutrino astronomy: the same hadronic models thought to give rise to the muon puzzle are also used to predict part of the atmospheric neutrino flux, a key background in traditional neutrino observatories.

**5.** TAMBO's sensitivity to neutrino messengers in the PeV to EeV energy range will help map the neutrino sky, search for of new physics, and unlock the door to a new era of neutrino astronomy-moving the field from deep ice and deep waters into the deep valley. In Quechua, the indigenous language spoken in the Andean mountains, tambo means 'inn': it was the name of a building in the Inca empire used as a resting place for messengers traversing the mountains. The TAMBO experiment echoes this; it will be a home for cosmic neutrino messengers that bring news from the highest-energy phenomena in the Universe.
