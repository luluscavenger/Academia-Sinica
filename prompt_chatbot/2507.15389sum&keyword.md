## Abstract
This study examines the influence of intercrossing fiber bundles in the extensor mechanism of fingers on muscle force transmission. Unlike previous models idealizing the extensor mechanism as a minimal network of distinct strings, we developed a comprehensive numerical model incorporating fiber bundles. Our findings demonstrate that these bundles, often excluded in earlier models, significantly impact force transmission, with variations dependent on finger posture. Using a two-way ANOVA test, we identified significant interactions between posture and force distribution across fiber bundles under different loading conditions. Compared to a trivial model lacking these bundles, the full model exhibited a smaller feasible tendon force set, indicating biomechanical coupling. These insights suggest that the extensor mechanism's evolutionary development not only enhances force transmission but also supports stability and precise movements, crucial for tasks such as grasping and writing. This work advances understanding of finger biomechanics and has potential applications in prosthetic design and robotic systems, providing a framework for future studies on the complex anatomy of human fingers.

## Key Findings
1. The study introduces a detailed model of the extensor mechanism, incorporating intercrossing fiber bundles, to analyze their role in muscle force transmission, contrasting it with a simplified 'trivial' model.
2. The results indicate that intercrossing fiber bundles significantly affect force transmission, which varies with finger posture, as demonstrated through simulations across different postures and loading conditions.
3. A two-way ANOVA test showed significant effects of posture on forces in intercrossing fiber bundles, with variations in force distribution depending on the bundle type and posture, under both 2.9 N and 5.9 N loading conditions.
4. The full extensor mechanism model, which includes intercrossing fiber bundles, provides a smaller feasible tendon force set area compared to the trivial model, suggesting a biomechanical coupling in force transmission.
5. The study suggests that the extensor mechanism's evolutionary adaptation may support stability and precise slow movements in addition to force transmission, offering insights into neuromuscular strategies for finger control and potential applications in prosthetics and robotic hands.
