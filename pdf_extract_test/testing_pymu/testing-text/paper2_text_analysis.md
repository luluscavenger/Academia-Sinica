### ABSTRACT

ABSTRACT
We scrutinize the paradigm that conventional long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the dominant source of the ultrahigh
energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) within the internal shock scenario by describing UHECR spectrum and composition and by
studying the predicted (source and cosmogenic) neutrino ﬂuxes. Since it has been demonstrated that the stacking searches forastrophysical GRB neutrinos strongly constrain the parameter space in single-zone models, we focus on the dynamics of multiple
collisions for which different messengers are expected to come from different regions of the same object. We propose a model
that can describe both stochastic and deterministic engines, which we study in a systematic way. We ﬁnd that GRBs can indeeddescribe the UHECRs for a wide range of different model assumptions with comparable quality albeit with the previously known
problematic energy requirements; the heavy mass fraction at injection is found to be larger than 70 per cent (95 per cent CL). We
demonstrate that the post-dicted (from UHECR data) neutrino ﬂuxes from sources and UHECR propagation are indeed belowthe current sensitivities but will be reached by the next generation of experiments. We ﬁnally critically review the required sourceenergetics with the speciﬁc examples found in this study.
Key words: neutrinos – gamma-ray burst: general – cosmic rays.

### 1 INTRODUCTION

1 INTRODUCTION
Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have been proposed to be powerful
enough to describe ultrahigh energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) (Vietri
1995 ; Waxman 1995 ). The interactions of cosmic rays with photons
in the source can lead to substantial neutrino production during the
prompt emission phase of gamma rays, see e.g. Waxman & Bahcall
(1997 ), Murase & Nagataki ( 2006 ), and H ¨ummer, Baerwald & Winter
(2012 ). In this work, we focus on conventional long-duration GRBs
with isotropic luminosities around 1052.5erg s−1(Gruber et al. 2014 ).
The searches for GRB neutrinos are highly sensitive because thedirectional, timing, and energy information can be used to suppress
background. Therefore, the neutrino ﬂux limits from the IceCube
Observatory for GRBs are the best among all potential sourceclasses (Abbasi et al. 2012 ; Aartsen et al. 2017 ). Besides that,
the observation of a temporally and spatially coincident neutrino
emission is one of the few ways to locate transient cosmic rayaccelerators such as GRBs. So far, no source neutrinos from GRBs
have been observed. The interaction of cosmic rays with the cosmic
backgrounds during propagation to the Earth can also lead to a
‘cosmogenic’ neutrino ﬂux (Berezinsky & Zatsepin 1969 ; Aab
et al. 2017 ; Alves Batista et al. 2019 ;H e i n z ee ta l . 2019 ) but no
cosmogenic neutrinos have been found either (Aartsen et al. 2018 ;
⋆E-mail: annika.rudolph@desy.deAab et al. 2019 ). A model-dependent correlation analysis of the
UHECR arrival directions with source catalogs, performed by thePierre Auger Observatory for active galactic nuclei and starburst
galaxies, indicates an intermediate-scale anisotropy related to the
distribution of nearby UHECR sources (Aab et al. 2018 ). According
to this result, only a limited fraction of the observed UHECR ﬂux can
be attributed to known starburst galaxies or active galactic nuclei,
leaving the main contribution to the UHECR ﬂux unconstrained.GRBs may be therefore a conceivable option for the remaining part.
In this study, we follow the hypothesis that GRBs are the dominant
sources of the UHECRs and describe the UHECR spectrum and com-position within the internal shock scenario (Rees & Meszaros 1994 ;
Kobayashi, Piran & Sari 1997 ; Daigne & Mochkovitch 1998 ). It has
been shown that simple one-zone-emission models are in tensionwith the neutrino ﬂux limits for most of the parameter space, both
for the case of a pure proton composition (Baerwald, Bustamante &
Winter 2015 ) and for a heavier primary composition (Biehl et al.
2018 ). This argument follows from the overproduction of source
neutrinos due to high radiation densities in the source (Biehl et al.
2018 ) for luminosities and collision radii typically assumed for GRBs
– which points towards alternative sources, such as low-luminosity
GRBs (Zhang et al. 2018 ; Boncioli, Biehl & Winter 2019 ; see also
Murase et al. 2008 ; Samuelsson et al. 2019 ).
Multicollision models, such as the one discussed in this work,
exhibit a lower neutrino ﬂux (Bustamante et al. 2015 ;G l o b u se ta l .
2015a ), which is typically dominated by cosmic ray interactions close

UHECR nuclei in GRB multicollision models 5991
to the photosphere where the radiation densities are high. If only a
small fraction of the collisions occurs there, the overall neutrinoﬂux is lower than in the single zone model for the same proton
injection luminosity. For a discussion of the production regions
of cosmic messengers, the impact of the engine properties on thedifferent messengers and light curves in different energy bands, and
the dependence on the collision model for the shells, see Bustamante
et al. ( 2015 ,2017 ) and Rudolph et al. ( 2020 ).
In contrast to one-zone models, multicollision models add the
possibility of studying different jet structures and corresponding light
curves. A multipeaked light curve can be generated by a smoothLorentz factor variation in the outﬂow, short-time variability by
additional random variations ( stochasticity ) in the Lorentz factor pro-
ﬁle. A discussion on different outﬂow structures and correspondinglight curves can be found in, e.g. Daigne & Mochkovitch ( 1998 )
and Bosnjak, Daigne & Dubus ( 2009 ). Also, Bustamante et al.
(2017 ) investigate different Lorentz factor proﬁles in connection
with neutrino and gamma-ray light curves for proton-loaded jets,
however, without ﬁtting the source parameters to data. Most GRB
multicollision models do not jointly describe the UHECR spectrum
and composition – except Globus et al. ( 2015a ) and Globus, Allard &
Parizot ( 2015b ), who performed a complete investigation of the
multicollision model in the context of UHECR including nuclei for
a smooth, continuous outﬂow that corresponds to a single-peaked
light curve without a short-time variability or an intermittent engine.They draw a self-consistent picture for one set of parameters and one
collision model, with a neutrino ﬂux prediction close to the current
stacking limit. No substantial progress on the subject has been madesince then, owing to the computational complexity of the problem.
In Section 2 of this paper, we present our multicollision GRB
model for different outﬂow patterns accounting for a smooth tem-poral proﬁle (a ramp-up of the Lorentz factor towards later times)
in combination with a stochastic engine behaviour, mainly based
on an extension of the techniques developed in our previous works.Section 3 describes the systematic scan over the engine parameters
and how these are estimated from UHECR data. For the ﬁrst time,
we obtain contours on the allowed parameter space from UHECRdata and discuss the result in detail based on four representative
cases. Section 4 is dedicated to the multimessenger signatures, i.e .
the light curves and the neutrino ﬂux predictions. We aim to concludewhether the absence of associations of IceCube neutrinos with GRBs
(Abbasi et al. 2012 ) really disfavours, or even excludes, those as a
dominant source of UHECRs when a more sophisticated model forthe multimessenger production is used.

dk. Due to the gradient in velocity, the more rapid shells will
eventually catch up to slower shells. A collision between a rapidshell (index r) and a slow shell (index s) forms a new, merged shell
(index m). Due to energy conservation, the energy dissipated during
the collision is given by the difference of kinetic energy before and
after the collision:
EC=mr/Gamma1r+ms/Gamma1s−(mr+ms)/Gamma1m. (1)
Momentum and mass conservation implies that the Lorentz factor of

In Daigne & Mochkovitch ( 1998 ), most of the energy is dissipated
during the initial phase where the less massive shell sweeps up amass equal to its own in the other shell, such that /Gamma1
C=√/Gamma1r·/Gamma1s.
We follow this assumption here, diverting from Bustamante et al.
(2017 ). Individual and merged shells continue to propagate in the
ﬁreball until they collide with other shells or reach the circumburst
medium, where they are taken out of the simulation. The circumburst
medium is assumed to dominate the outﬂow dynamics at a distanceR

we do not calculate of the deceleration radius for each ﬁreball
explicitly, but instead impose this general value compatible withtheoretical estimates (Rees & Meszaros 1992 ) and values inferred
from observations (Liang et al. 2010 ).
In each collision particles are accelerated and emitted. We assume
that the time-scale of emission δt

shock takes to cross the rapid shell. Since both shells get compressed
during the collision process, the width of the merged shell is reducedduring the collision ( l

formulas for δtemandlm,Cis contained in Kobayashi et al. ( 1997 )
and Bustamante et al. ( 2017 ). In a different scenario, the internal
energy remaining in the shell after the collision will result in an
expansion of the merged shell, which is discussed in more detail in
Rudolph et al. ( 2020 ). Here, we assume that the merged shell after
the collision recovers the width of a single shell before the collision
(lm,ﬁ n a l=ls=lr). At all times, the shells contained in the ﬁreball
thus share the same width. In Globus et al. ( 2015a ), shell widths do
not play a role since the energy densities are computed assuming
a constant kinetic wind luminosity. This approach is strictly validonly for the ﬁrst round of collisions and roughly corresponds to the
assumption of a constant shell width.
The ﬁnal emitted particle spectra are computed by summing over
all single collision spectra. A collision that occurs at time t

We calculate the time-dependent ﬂux from each collision assuming
a ‘fast rise and exponential decay’ (FRED) shape normalized to the
total gamma-ray luminosity of the collision (see Kobayashi et al.1997 ; Bustamante et al. 2017 for details).

This choice is known to reproduce the smooth and broad peak struc-
ture observed in many GRB light curves. Although a decelerationat the end is not forbidden in this model, it would not contribute to
the emission since slow shells cannot catch up and interact with the

the equal kinetic energy Ekinper shell.
2.1.2 Benchmark engine proﬁles
In order to simplify the discussion and the visualization of our results,
we deﬁne four distinct initial benchmark shell conﬁgurations. Withthe formulae from the last section those correspond to four choices
of/Gamma1
min,/Gamma1max,a n dA/Gamma1that deﬁne the strength of the ramp-up and the
stochasticity of the engine.
The stochastic ﬂuctuations of the Lorentz factors are considered to
be related to the short time variability on top of a pulsed light curve
and have been studied in the ﬁreball framework in the past, see e.g.Daigne & Mochkovitch ( 1998 ). Globus et al. ( 2015a ) examine the
case of a disciplined engine, adding no stochasticity to the ramp-up
structure. In addition to the former works, we study the impact of
stochastic engine behaviour and the strength of the ramp-up in the
multimessenger context including a ﬁt to the observed UHECRs.
The four cases are shown in Fig. 1and, sorted by increasing
stochasticity, correspond to the following:
(1)Strong ramp-up, no stochasticity (SR-0S) : Strong ramp-up of
the mean Lorentz factor towards later times (thus smaller radii), no
stochasticity.
(2)Strong ramp-up, low stochasticity (SR-LS) : Strong ramp-up of
the mean Lorentz factor, some stochasticity. The shell distribution is
mainly dominated by the ramp-up.
(3)Weak ramp-up, medium stochasticity (WR-MS) : Moderate
ramp-up of the mean Lorentz factor, medium stochasticity. The
proﬁle and the stochastic features are both pronounced.
(4)Weak ramp-up, high stochasticity (WR-HS) : Weak ramp-up of
the mean Lorentz factor towards later times, high stochasticity. The
shell distribution is dominated by the stochasticity, the structure ofthe proﬁle /Gamma1

The initial Lorentz factors are illustrated in Fig. 1where we also

2.2 Radiation model
The radiation produced by each collision is computed independently
using the time-dependent radiation code NEUCOSMA (Biehl et al.
2018 ). The total spectrum is then obtained as the sum over all
collisions. The energy dissipated in a collision is distributed among
cosmic rays ( /epsilon1CR), electrons ( /epsilon1e) and magnetic ﬁeld ( /epsilon1B) such that /epsilon1CR
+/epsilon1B+/epsilon1e=1 and injected into the radiation model. We deﬁne the
baryonic loading as fb=1/fe=/epsilon1CR//epsilon1eand calculate the magnetic ﬁeld
following Bustamante et al. ( 2017 ) assuming equipartition between
photons and the magnetic ﬁeld ( /epsilon1B∼/epsilon1e).
Assuming fast cooling of electrons (which is plausible due to the
generally high magnetic ﬁelds and necessary to efﬁciently convert
internal energy into radiation), each collision deposits Eγ,C=/epsilon1eECin
gamma rays. We do not explicitly model the photon ﬁelds but instead
assume a ﬁxed shape resembling observations: A broken power-law
peaking at /epsilon1/prime=1 keV (primed indices refer to the comoving frame of
the emitting material) with spectral indices α=−1a n dβ=−2. We
do not explicitly model the target photon spectrum here, but instead
postulate that observations are described by the underlying radiationmodel. More explicit radiative modelling of the photon ﬁelds, such
as the one in Globus et al. ( 2015a ), would lead to a dependence of
the (synchrotron) peak energy on the collision parameters, namely

the magnetic ﬁeld and dissipated energy per mass. For an engine
as SR-0S, we expect a simple evolution from higher to lower peakenergies as collisions move outside. Stochasticity in the Lorentz
factor distribution is expected to add a (stochastic) spread in the
distribution of peak energies. The more detailed treatment of theseeffects goes beyond the scope of this study and would additionally
require a radiation model for the electromagnetic processes in the
presence of hadronic interactions. We ensure that the maximal photonenergy is high enough in order not to impact the multimessenger
production unless the optical thickness to pair-production exceeds
unity, when we impose a cut-off there. For detailed modelling ofGRB spectral energy distribution in the internal shock model, see
e.g.Bosnjak et al. ( 2009 ), Daigne, Bosnjak & Dubus ( 2011 ), and
Boˇsnjak & Daigne ( 2014 ).
We simulate the nuclear system with the time-dependent radiation

balancing acceleration with losses due to photohadronic interactions,photodisintegration, photopair production, synchrotron emission,
and adiabatic expansion of the emitting material. For the acceleration,
the maximal efﬁciency of η=1 is assumed (Bohm limit). Instead
of the interaction time-scale t

the effective energy loss time-scale t/prime

intlimits the maximal
energy for photodisintegration, which is a rough estimate assumingthat a single nucleon is ejected per interaction. This assumption is
justiﬁed because we only consider different mass groups for the in-
jection, namely hydrogen, helium, nitrogen, silicon, and iron, whichmeans nearby isotopes are not distinguished. Protons are limited
by the effective cooling time-scale for photomeson production. The
integral fractions of the injection elements are deﬁned as

They are free parameters of the simulation and are determined by the
ﬁt to UHECR data later. Thus, the ﬁt result resembles an effective or
average composition since the initial mass fractions do not explicitely
depend on the initial shell radius. We deﬁne the heavy mass fraction(HMF) as ( I
N+ISi+IFe)/(IH+IHe+IN+ISi+IFe).

In order to compute the emitted particle spectra, additional as-
sumptions on the escape mechanisms have to be made. In Baerwald,Bustamante & Winter ( 2013 ) and Biehl et al. ( 2018 ), neutral particles
free-stream, while charged particles escape if the edge of the
emitting region is within their Larmor radius. This yields an effectiveescape rate which is comparable to a Bohm-like diffusion process.
However, the simulations presented in Globus et al. ( 2015a ) suggest
a different behaviour more similar to a high-pass ﬁlter, leading
harder, bell-shape escape spectra. Similarly, hard escape spectra
were analytically derived in Ohira, Murase & Yamazaki ( 2010 )
as∝exp (−ln
2(E/Emax)), where the escape is most efﬁcient at the
maximal energy Emax. For this study, we employ the analytical form
derived in Ohira et al. ( 2010 ) that yields similar results to Globus
et al. ( 2015a ) – supported by the argument that it well describes
UHECR data.
A sizable fraction of collisions may occur below the photosphere
deﬁned by τ/prime
Th=1( w h e r e τ/prime
This the optical depth to Thomson
scattering) for each individual shell collision, see App. A.4 in
Bustamante et al. ( 2017 ) for details. Sub-photospheric collisions,
in principle, may lead to high neutrino ﬂuxes if the observed photon
spectrum is simply extrapolated to below the photosphere. However,
below the photospere shocks are radiation mediated and cosmic raysare not subjected to an abrupt large bulk velocity difference, since
their mean free path is shorter than the shock transition region. In
consequence, Fermi acceleration is hindered except for a ﬁne-tuned
combination of conditions (Sironi & Spitkovsky 2011 ; Beloborodov
2017 ), and the target photon spectrum almost certainly has a different
shape. A simple extrapolation of the radiation model that we apply
for the prompt phase therefore tends to overestimate the expected
neutrino emission when assuming similar acceleration efﬁciency.The absence of neutrino observations from GRBs in IceCube may
indicate that if GRBs are indeed sources of UHECR, the contribution
of sub-photospheric collisions must not be very large in order tonot violate the current limits. In light of the reasons set out above,
we omit particle emission from sub-photospheric collisions in our
model and only take into account collisions occurring in the opticallythin regime. To avoid an unphysical bias in the parameter scan due
to this penalty, we exclude models with less than 40 per cent of
energy dissipated above the photosphere from the interpretation ofthe parameter scan.

2.3 Multimessenger emission regions
Here, we discuss the two extreme examples SR-0S and WR-MS to
illustrate the basic behaviour of the source model and the effect ofthe source parameters. For this purpose, the injection composition
is ﬁxed to identical values for the four examples, whereas in later
sections the I
Abecome free parameters of the ﬁt. The particle emis-
sion regions in the left-hand panel of Fig. 2reﬂect the distribution of
collisions within the ﬁreball and thus are a direct consequence of the
initial Lorentz factor distribution. Collisions occur ﬁrst where the gra-dient in speed is maximal since /Delta1β=β

r.
The ramp-up in the Lorentz factor distribution results in the bulk of
the particle emission around happening at radii above RC∼7·10
14cm. Due to the absence of stochastic engine behaviour in SR-0S,
collisions with subsequent particle emission occur up to a radius of
5×1015cm, which corresponds to the point where the latest emitted
shell runs into the bulk of slow merged shells. Neutrino emission
peaks close to the photosphere where collisions are optically thick.
The radial dependence of the nuclear composition, shown in theright-hand panel of Fig. 2, is determined by the interplay between
the dominant cooling process and maximal energy and is different
for each type of nucleus.
Emission of heavier nuclei starting from the CNO group is
suppressed at lower radii due to photonuclear interactions, while
efﬁcient acceleration retains a high emission up to the maximal

and regular emission curves reﬂects that the number such collisions within the light-shaded band is small. The second bump, visible at RC∼7·1014cm is
related to the bulk collision and controlled by the gradient of the initial Lorentz factor distribution as described in the text. While the radial depe ndence at the
bulk collision resembles the behaviour of the SR-0S case in Fig. 2, the ﬁreball develops efﬁcient particle emission at much larger radii.

towards outer radii since acceleration becomes less efﬁcient.

distribution a two-bump shape develops (Fig. 3) where the second
bump comes from the bulk collision and the collisions at lower
radii from collisions between neighboring shells due to random
ﬂuctuations in their Lorentz factors. The height of the second peak,and thus efﬁcient UHECR emission, depends on the choice of A

and the amount of energy left over from the random collisions atlower radii or earlier times. If the stochasticity is excessively high,
the energy remaining in the ﬁreball for the bulk collision at larger
radii is too low to produce a signiﬁcant output of UHECR. At the
same time, the bulk Lorentz factor decreases and harsher assumptionshave to be made for /Gamma1

3.1 Source population and UHECR transport models
We adopt the cosmological distribution of GRBs derived by Wan-
derman & Piran ( 2010 ) based on the analysis of Swift GRBs:
RGRB(z)=RGRB(0)·/braceleftBigg
(1+z)2.1,z≤3
(1+3)2.1+1.4(1+z)−1.4,z> 3.(7)
Due to computational constraints all GRBs are computed at an
injected luminosity of 1053erg/s instead of using the full luminosity
distribution. The suppression of radiation from subphotospheric
collisions yields an emitted luminosity close to 1052.5erg/s, which
is close to the observed break luminosity in Liang, Zhang & Dai
(2007 ).
For the extragalactic propagation, we employ identical tools as
in Heinze et al. ( 2019 ), i.e. the numerical code PRINCE and the
distributed ﬁtting framework. All unstable nuclear isotopes lighter
than iron including neutrons decay at injection or immediately atproduction since the decay length is typically much shorter than
the interaction length. The chain of decay products is followed
down to protons, stable nuclei, and neutrinos, which are producedin charged pion and muon decays. The model for the extragalactic
background light (EBL) is Gilmore et al. ( 2012 ) and the photonuclear
disintegration model is
TALYS (Koning et al. 2007 ). It is noteworthy
that in this study, the nuclear disintegration within the source and
during propagation have been simulated with the same nucleardisintegration model. The effects of propagation in the host galaxy are
not taken into account due to the low photon ﬁelds and the negligible
size of the galaxy for UHECR treated in the ballistic approximation.

### 3.2 UHECR interactions and ﬁt method

3.2 UHECR interactions and ﬁt method
Each GRB model (deﬁned by a triple /Gamma1
min,/Gamma1max,a n dA/Gamma1) produces
an individual set of nuclear and neutrino spectra at the Earth for eachof the ﬁve injection masses. The superposition of the nuclear spectra
yields /angbracketleftlnA/angbracketrightandσ(lnA) that are converted into the corresponding
/angbracketleftX
max/angbracketrightandσ(Xmax) following Abreu et al. ( 2013 ).
The purpose of our study is to perform a systematic parameter
space scan over the model parameters and composition. Unfortu-
nately, the number of free parameters in the model (initial distributionof Lorentz factors /Gamma1
k, kinetic energies Ek, width lk, and separa-
tion dkof the shells) exceeds the constraints from the (integrated
and angular-averaged) spectrum and composition measurements ofUHECRs. We make an initial guess for the parameters described
in Section 2.1, in particular for the initial shell distribution and
injections compositions, that appear suitable to ﬁt the spectrum. Theassumption of equal energy per emitted shell imposes constrains
on multiple shell parameters such as separation and width. Another
criterion for a suitable model is a sufﬁcient maximal rigidity similarto that observed in the UHECR spectrum. It results in constraints on
the average emission radius and magnetic ﬁelds, which are mainly
controlled by the initial distribution of Lorentz factors that translateinto shell speeds.

we do not include the second moment of the Xmaxdistribution in the

fraction is linear, this is only approximately true for the source model
since a higher baryonic fraction may shift some collisions into thephotosphere and change the emission spectra, see discussion in Bus-
tamante et al. ( 2017 ). We veriﬁed in separate simulations that the im-
pact of this non-linearity is small within our current parameter ranges.

### 3.3 Systematic parameter space search

3.3 Systematic parameter space search
As outlined in Section 2.3 the engine parameters /Gamma1min,/Gamma1max,a n dA/Gamma1
affect the distribution of collisions along the jet and their properties,
and thus impact the particle interactions and shift the emissionregions of messengers. We systematically scan the engine parameter
space in /Gamma1
min,/Gamma1max,a n dA/Gamma1assuming that the model represents the
emission of all GRB that power the UHECR ﬂux. We continuouslyadjust the fraction that goes into non-thermal baryons f
band the
integral injection fractions for the nuclear species such that the
observed UHECR spectrum and composition is ﬁtted for each engineconﬁguration. As we will see, the ﬁt contours enclose a relatively
wide range of GRB realizations, implying that it is possible to obtain
similar ﬁts but with a superposition of multiple GRB models. We donot attempt this kind of generalization since it simply increases the
number of free parameters.
The ﬁt result is shown in Fig. 4where the third variable is integrated
out or summed over for each 2D distribution. For each point in /Gamma1
min,
/Gamma1max,a n dA/Gamma1, the ﬁve baryonic loadings, the energy scale uncertainty
of the data has been obtained by (continuous) minimization. The
contours for the 3 σconﬁdence interval enclose a large parameter
space, demonstrating that the model (ﬁt) is relatively robust againstparameter changes. Engines without stochastic behaviour A
/Gamma1=0
are disfavoured as well as those with /Gamma1max<200. The 1 σand 2σ
contours favour engines that produce an average /Gamma1bulk∼200−400
indicated by the iso-contours in the upper left-hand panel. That is
per se interesting, as a bulk Lorentz factor around 300 has been
reconstructed from observations (see e.g. Ghirlanda et al. 2018 ),
which we recover by completely different means. The best ﬁt belongs
to the WR-MS engine type with a weak ramp up and medium
stochasticity. Our model is not applicable within the white-shadedregion at lower /Gamma1
minin which more than 60 per cent of energy is
dissipated below the photosphere. Except a small overlap with the
1σcontour and a narrower secondary minimum with a very high
stochasticity, the UHECR ﬁt prefers GRB realizations for which
most energy is dissipated above the photosphere.
For the discussions that follow further below, we choose four
examples indicated by the markers in Fig. 4. The rough criteria to
choose these examples we motivated by a similar /Gamma1bulk∼320 as the

3.4 Source spectra
To illustrate how different engine behaviors affect the ejected cosmic
ray spectra, we show in Fig. 5the ejected spectrum from the source
for each of the four example cases. The weights for the ﬁve intregralfractions of the injection masses are obtained from the ﬁt, the initial
composition of the jet is thus different for each of the example cases.
By adding stochasticity, the emission of nuclei is spread out among
a larger range of radii compared to the case of no stochasticity
(SR-0S). With stochasticity, collisions can occur at smaller radii,
where optical depths for photonuclear interactions are high andmore secondary nucleons (the red curves) are produced through
disintegration. This also leads to higher neutrino emission.
The smaller cosmic ray production region close to the engine of
SR-0S is also reﬂected in smaller maximal energies of cosmic ray
nuclei, as the upper left-hand panel of Fig. 5clearly shows. Higher
maximal energies are reached by stochastic engines through colli-sions that occur at outer radii where the acceleration of heavier nuclei
is still efﬁcient but the source is transparent enough for nuclei to es-
cape. These collisions will negligibly contribute to the total neutrinooutput. The distribution of collisions among many radii in stochastic
models can, however, yield neutrino bright and UHECR dim, and,
UHECR bright and neutrino dim collisions within the same astro-physical object in contrast to one-zone models as in Biehl et al. ( 2018 )
or multicollision models dominated by one bulk collision (SR-0S).
Concerning the spectral shape, the contributions of collisions that
are spread out along all radii in models with higher stochastic
component lead to a softening/broadening of the emission spectra
for individual mass groups. This is demonstrated in Fig. 5where the
spectra from each collision are illustrated by thin and the total output
by the thick curves. For models dominated by the bulk collision
(SR-0S and SR-LS) the spectra are clearly narrower.

3.5 UHECR spectra at the Earth and general aspects of the ﬁt
Following the ejected spectra, we discuss the corresponding observed
spectra and general properties of the ﬁt for the four example cases.
Comparing observed to ejected spectra, one has to bear in mind
general effects of extragalactic propagation. Interactions with back-ground photons during propagation generally lead to a ﬂux depletion
of nuclei with energies above the threshold for photodisintegration.
Secondary nuclei that emerge from photonuclear interactions popu-late the spectra at lower energies, softening the spectrum at the Earth
compared to that at the source. Because the boost is approximately
conserved during disintegration, the energy E

by the relation Es=As/Ap·Ep. The lighter secondary nuclei from
disintegration, therefore, show up at lower energy.
The spectra at the Earth are shown in Fig. 6. It is remarkable how
well the spectrum and the /angbracketleftXmax/angbracketrightare reproduced with such different
source spectra and engine properties.
To ﬁt the observed UHECR spectrum for different engine real-
izations, we adjust the integral fractions of the injection elements
at the source (equation 6) for the four benchmark cases. The
integral fractions resulting from the ﬁt are listed in Table 1.I n
all cases, data require more than 50 per cent of intermediate nuclei
(N and Si) injected at the source. The WR-MS and WR-HS cases
require an even higher ( >70 per cent) integral fraction of silicon and
iron at injection to compensate for their depletion due to efﬁcient
photodisintegration in the source. An unavoidable counterpart toefﬁcient photodisintegration is the high abundance of secondary
neutrons in the source (the thin red curves in Fig. 5). This is reﬂected
in the integral fractions that do not require any additional proton
injection in the source when stochasticity is present.
In the absence of stochasticity, the SR-0S case requires a
22 per cent proton integral fraction at injection to compensate for
the low disintegration in the source. Since the high maximal energiesrequired by data are barely reached at the source, the ﬁt pulls the
energy scale ( δ
E<0 means data move towards lower energy) to
minimize the tension. Because maximal energies are smaller, themissing abundance of light elements is not well compensated through
disintegration during propagation. The high maximal energies at the
source for WR-MS and WR-HS (visible in the lower panels of Fig. 5)
affect the spectrum at and beyond the cut-off energies in the lower
panels of Fig. 6that show an onset of recovery above 2 ×10
11GeV .

UHECR nuclei in GRB multicollision models 5999
Interestingly, the SR-0S case does not require any (primary)
helium to be injected into the source. Therefore, all helium issecondary, i.e .a product of photodisintegration in the source or the
propagation. However, we notice that this might also be an effect
of the disintegration model (
TALYS ) used in the computation. The
production of helium, and its subsequent disintegration, is strongly
affected by the uncertainties in the disintegration cascade, due to
absence of data and models (Alves Batista et al. 2015 ; Boncioli et al.
2017 ). For the stochastic cases, the origin of helium in UHECR at
the Earth is both primary and secondary.
In simpler models, the succession of increasingly heavier mass
spectra towards higher energies is often assumed to be caused by
a maximal rigidity reached by the accelerator or one acceleration
zone. As we show with these stochastic multicollision models, thisassumption is not essential to describe the spectrum and the /angbracketleftX
max/angbracketright.
In SR-LS and WR-MS, the heaviest mass group at the cut-off is
mostly silicon and not iron. For WR-MS and WR-HS, the cut-off forthe proton spectrum at the Earth reaches or exceeds that of the helium
or the nitrogen group, conﬁrming that the data do not require that
the maximal energy at ejection follows the Peters cycle, as already
found for example in Biehl et al. ( 2018 ). This is already visible in
the source spectra and is enhanced at the Earth since protons areabundantly produced during propagation of heavier elements with
energies close to, or above the observed cut-off.
A real discrimination of the models and a crucial piece of the origin
of UHECR puzzle may come from the width of the X
maxdistribution,
σ(Xmax). The data require that while the composition has to become
heavier towards higher energies, this transition has to happen througha smooth gradual succession between neighboring mass groups (see
e.g. Aab et al. 2017 ), which minimizes the overlap of different mass
spectra. For example, the /angbracketleftX
max/angbracketrightcould in principle be described by a
mixture of just protons and iron. The overlap of protons and heavier
spectra would, however, lead to large ﬂuctuations in Xmaxproducing
σ(Xmax) distribution that is ﬂat or increasing in energy, contrary to
what is observed.
Clearly, our model does not describe σ(Xmax) sufﬁciently well. If
we include σ(Xmax)i nt h e χ2deﬁnition in equation (8), the result only
marginally improves at the cost of narrow contours. The preferred
models tend to have fewer optically thin collisions contributing to
the emission and mostly lie at the edge of the range in which ourmodel is applicable. The reasons for this behaviour are twofold and
can be understood by comparing Figs 5and6:
(i) Since collisions from different radii contribute to the total
output, the maximal energies of individual collisions cover a wider
range (see the coloured ‘bands’ in the SR-0S panel of Fig. 5that are
comprised of successive thin curves). When those are summed (thick,coloured curves for each mass group) the total spectra are much
wider than the individual bell shapes, equivalent to a softening of
the mass group spectra. For stochastic engines this effect is strongersince there is a wider spread in the maximal energy of individual
positions. In combination with a positive source evolution, softer
spectra are known to produce worse ﬁts. Heinze et al. ( 2019 )s h o w e d
that this behaviour persists for positive redshift evolutions across
various model combinations used for the simulation of air showers
and extragalactic propagation.
(ii) The second reason is the strong overlap of light and heavy mass
spectra in stochastic models, in particular the abundance of protons at
the highest energies in the lower panels of Fig. 6. The required smooth
succession of heavier masses is violated and hence σ(X
max) cannot
decrease as in the data. This is related to the level of disintegration in
the source, the maximal energy required to ﬁt the observed spectrum,and the level of disintegration of heavy elements on the extragalactic
photon ﬁelds during propagation. A signiﬁcant suppression of in-source disintegration is not easily possible if electrons and nuclei
are accelerated by the same mechanism and radiate within the same
volume.
We note that similar effects will occur when giving up the
assumption of identical GRBs. If multiple GRBs or other generic
accelerators with different maximal rigidities or intrinsic luminositiescontribute to the observed average UHECR ﬂux, the average of
source spectra will be softer/broader than that of individual objects.
The same problem in describing σ(X
max) will therefore occur for
any model that uses a population of distant sources with different
maximal rigidities. On the other hand, a mechanism that generally
suppresses photodisintegration may reduce the tension of the modelwithσ(X
max) observations, but would likely also reduce emission of
secondary messengers such as photons or neutrinos, rendering the
attempt to discover UHECR sources with multimessenger techniquesa stiffer challenge than it already is.

### 3.6 Source energetics
A well-known problem for the GRB origin of UHECRs is the

3.6 Source energetics
A well-known problem for the GRB origin of UHECRs is the
large required isotropic-equivalent energy emitted in baryons around
2–3×10
53erg per GRB in the UHECR range (Baerwald et al.
2015 ; here computed for the Wanderman-Piran GRB evolution).
This estimate is a consequence of the required local emissivity
∼1044erg Mpc−3yr−1to sustain the ﬂux of UHECRs with a local
GRB rate around 1 Gpc−3yr−1. This implies that the required kinetic
energy must be much larger, even if most of it is efﬁciently transferred
into escaping non-thermal baryons with the highest energies .T h e
dissipation efﬁciency (transfer from kinetic energy to non-thermalradiation) is only one part of the problem, the other is how to
accelerate baryons to the highest energies without retaining much
of it below the UHECR energy range.
The four examples have been chosen to describe GRBs with
gamma-ray energies in the ball park of a few times 10
52erg (row
Eγin Table 1). In fact, the overall normalization is Eγ≡1053erg
but sub-photospheric collisions do not contribute to this budget
and hence the resulting energy output is lower. The fraction of
energy emitted in superphotospheric collisions (see respective row)isf
sup≡Eγ/1053erg ranging between 40 per cent and 80 per cent
for the majority of parameter combinations.
The initial kinetic energy Ekin, init is mostly converted into baryons
due to relatively high baryonic loading. The energy ejected as
UHECRs can be written as3
Eesc

where /epsilon1dissis the fraction of kinetic energy dissipated into

CRis a bolometric correction describing how much energy
is deposited into the UHECR range, and fesc≡Eesc

/epsilon1diss/similarequal0.13−0.28, fesc/similarequal0.5, and fbol/similarequal0.07−0.08 for the chosen
four examples. Apart from the known dissipation efﬁciency problem
a large correction comes from fbolthat describes the fraction of non-
thermal baryons in the UHECR energy range. Although our model
implies that the baryons are picked up at low energies, such as in a

we neglect in these considerations.

thermal bath, this factor would be an order of magnitude larger if all
non-thermal particles were accelerated up to UHECR energies or ifthe acceleration spectra were harder than E
−2.
We ﬁnd that the (isotropic-equivalent) kinetic energy of the outﬂow
is∼1055−1056erg per GRB (see Ekin, init row in Table 1) if the long-
duration GRBs are the sole sources of UHECRs. Recent afterglow
observations indicate that a substantial fraction of the bulk kinetic
energy can escape observation (Abdalla et al. 2019 ;A c c i a r ie ta l .
2019 ), supporting earlier arguments (Fan & Piran 2006 ; Beniamini
et al. 2015 ; Beniamini, Nava & Piran 2016 ) about a systematic under-
estimation of kinetic energy. But even in view of the current resultsour ﬁndings may sound excessive. Some ingredients of this estimate
are certainly model dependent. For example, an order of magnitude
lower values ∼10
54–1055erg are found for hard (signiﬁcantly harder
than E−2) acceleration spectra, or when assuming an acceleration
mechanism with an extremely high transfer efﬁciency to the highest
energies. Nevertheless, from the energetics point of view a paradigmshift is required if conventional GRBs are indeed the sources of
UHECRs. Neutrino observations are an opportunity to independently
test this scenario.
It is interesting to compare our result to Gottlieb, Levinson &
Nakar ( 2020 ), who ﬁnd that ‘all intermittent jets are subject to heavy
baryon contamination that inhibits the emission at and above thephotosphere’. As we shown this baryon contamination is needed to
describe UHECRs. Our radiative (not dissipation) efﬁciency (energy
in photons versus kinetic energy) is between 5 ×10
−4and 0.003
(see Table 1), which is comparable to their result. So, perhaps
their negative conclusion for the gamma-ray signal actually indicates
that GRBs with intermittent engines are indeed efﬁcient cosmic rayaccelerators – for which a large baryon contamination is required. In
contrast to the choice of generic intermittance patters in Gottlieb et al.
(2020 ), our empirical Lorentz factor proﬁle and its parameters tend to
suppress early sub-photospheric collisions and avoid the rapid slow
down of the wind. Within our framework, we cannot answer if suchpatterns can be realized in ‘ab initio’ hydrodynamical simulations.

### 3.7 Heavy mass fraction at injection

3.7 Heavy mass fraction at injection
The HMF, deﬁned as the fraction of integrated energy released into
isotopes heavier than He, is reported in the last row of Table 1,
corresponding to the example cases and the best ﬁt. The increase in
the stochasticity clearly enhances the efﬁciency of the interactions inthe engine, imposing a higher injection of species heavier than He in
order to ﬁt the measured composition. The WR-HS, being extremein terms of stochasticity, is less efﬁcient in providing enough energy
at larger radii, and the requested HMF are smaller.
The HMF is above 0.7 within the 95 per cent CL (see Fig. 7,l e f t -
hand panel), and above 0.4 at the 3 σCL. This is mostly due to the in-
crease in the proton fraction (see Fig. 7, right-hand panel) which is al-
lowed within the three sigma contour, that includes a smaller level ofstochasticity with respect to the 1 σsigma contour. The large value of
the HMF is an outcome of the ﬁt, compared to Globus et al. ( 2015a ),
where it is 10 times larger than found in Galactic cosmic rays.
The separation of heavy and light masses at injection becomes
milder when the σ(X
max) is included in the ﬁt procedure. For this
reason, the allowed HMF is larger than 0.6 at 3 σif the ﬁt includes
theσ(Xmax), and the spread of the mass fractions is much less
pronounced.
In Zhang et al. ( 2018 ), several pre-supernova models have been
selected from Woosley & Heger ( 2006 ), to test the GRBs as sources
of UHECRs. In particular, models that provide a heavy distribution
of nuclear mass fractions at the onset of the core collapse are chosenin this paper, and such compositions are used as output of low-
luminosity GRBs with internal shock model, that are supposed to
power the UHECR ﬂux at the Earth. These have HMF greater than0.9, which is found to be compatible with our result independent of
the conﬁdence level.

and decreasing engine ramp-up. The case SR-0S corresponds to

a single-pulsed light curve in gamma rays. The increasing engine

UHECR nuclei in GRB multicollision models 6001
Figure 8. Resulting light curves (ﬂux as a function of time in gamma-ray and neutrinos) for the four example cases deﬁned in Fig. 1(see ﬁgure titles). The
light curves are obtained by assuming that each collision emits a fast rise and exponential decay peak (FRED), which is normalized to its total energy o uput.
Each light curve is shown for a single GRB assuming a redshift of two.
stochasticity adds time variability to that light curve, see SR-LS and
WR-MS. In the extreme case WR-HS, the ramp-up is sub-dominant,
the stochasticity of the engine leads to a very spiky light curve, and
the underlying (longer) pulse structure is gone. Thus these gamma-ray light curves are clearly qualitatively different, and may be used
as model discriminators for the individual GRB. Note that the height
of the individual peaks is determined by the luminosity of eachcollision, which increases with the difference in the Lorentz factors
of the colliding shells.
If the light curves are to be used as model discriminator for the
UHECR model, these results need to be compared to the whole
population of GRBs. That, however, is not trivial, as GRBs come
in a large variety of light curves and there are limitations to resolvethe time variability especially for GRBs detected with low statistics;
thus it is likely that there are selection effects. For example, while
most detected GRBs appear to be single pulsed with very simplestructure, they may be detected at too low statistics to resolve any
features or time structure. It is therefore conceivable that the whole
GRB population consists of a mix of different light-curve types,similar to the ones in Fig. 8. That is a subject beyond the scope of
this work which requires further study if light curves are to be used
as model-discriminator.
The neutrino light curves are correlated with the gamma-rays,
although there is no one-to-one correspondence. The reason for thatis that the pion production efﬁciency scales ∝R
−2
Cand that the
innermost collisions lead to higher neutrino production. In stochastic
models (e.g. WR-HS) the collision radii are randomly distributedand, in particular, not correlated with observation time. The neutrino
peaks are randomly enhanced compared to the gamma-ray peaksdepending on where that collision occurred. In deterministic models
(e.g.SR-0S), collision radius and observation time are correlated
such that the ﬁrst collisions come from the innermost radii and that
the neutrino production efﬁciency quickly drops with time. In suchGRBs, the very-high energetic (TeV) gamma rays can be surpressed
early-on because of gamma-gamma pair production, see Bustamante
et al. ( 2017 ) for a more detailed discussion.
One could use these observations for the optimization of the GRB
stacking searches: For single-pulsed light curves, the neutrinos are
expected to arrive early after the gamma-ray trigger (in the ﬁrstfew seconds for the s), whereas for highly variable light curves, the
neutrinos could arrive at any given time during T
90.

### 4.2 Post-dicted neutrino ﬂuxes from GRBs

4.2 Post-dicted neutrino ﬂuxes from GRBs
Neutrinos have been proposed in the past as a model discriminator
to potentially rule out the UHECR origin from GRBs. We therefore
derive the ‘post-dicted’ prompt and cosmogenic neutrino ﬂuxes from
the 3σcontour of the UHECR ﬁt in Fig. 4.T h e ya r es h o w nf o rt h e
source/prompt neutrinos and cosmogenic neutrinos as shaded regions
in the left-hand and right-hand panels of Fig. 9, respectively.
The deterministic engine (SR-0S) produces the lowest neutrino
ﬂux since the typical collision radius is large, and it is outside the
shaded range, since it is not within the 3 σcontours. The neutrino
ﬂux increases with stochasticity, as there are more collisions at lowcollision radii (but above the photosphere), see Figs 2and3.
The post-dicted prompt neutrino ﬂuxes (left-hand panel of Fig. 9)
are well below the GRB stacking limits from the IceCube Obser-

The shaded regions correspond to the range derived from the UHECR ﬁt (3 σ-contour in Fig. 4), the different curves to the different set-ups deﬁned in Fig. 1as

limit for IceCube-Gen2 (for 5000 bursts; Aartsen et al. 2020 ) are shown in the left-hand panel, and the current cosmogenic neutrino ﬂux limit (Aartsen et al.

vatory (Aartsen et al. 2017 ,2020 ). One way to interpret this result
is that even with generous variations among individual GRBs, theabsence of neutrino associations in the present detectors does not
exclude GRBs as the origin of UHECRs. Our model does not impose
exotic ﬁreball parameters, high baryonic loading or excessive Lorentzfactors. The computed neutrino ﬂuxes are derived in a post-dictive
way from the UHECR ﬁt without imposing any additional bias from
the non-observation of neutrinos by IceCube, and it is somewhatsurprising that no model within the 3 σUHECR ﬁt produces a
detectable prompt neutrino ﬂux. The ﬂuxes are compatible with
earlier estimates in Bustamante et al. ( 2015 ), Bustamante et al.
(2017 ), and Rudolph et al. ( 2020 ) for a ﬁxed baryonic loading,
whereas in this work these are obtained from the UHECR ﬁt (seeTable 1) by integrating over the entire source population. This
result demonstrates that the initial interpretation of IceCube’s non-
observation (Abbasi et al. 2012 ) can be regarded as too strong, and
that the UHECR origin from GRBs cannot be ruled out based on
neutrino observations, yet.
The next generation detectors, such as KM3Net-ARCA in the
Mediterranean Sea (Aiello et al. 2019 ), demonstrate promising full
sky sensitivity estimates for point-source detection and hence may
detect some of the GRBs. The planned IceCube-Gen2 detector at theSouth Pole will also have an enhanced sensitivity to GRBs because of
the signiﬁcantly larger effective area and because the stacking search
should be still statistics-limited. It is therefore conceivable that theexposure next-generation of neutrino experiments, in particular that
of IceCube-Gen2 as shown in Fig. 9, will be sufﬁcient to probe the
UHECR paradigm. It is expected that these future detectors can atleast exclude the cases with high source stochasticity.
Concerning cosmogenic neutrinos, Heinze et al. ( 2019 )a n dA l v e s
Batista et al. ( 2019 ) demonstrated that for alike, homogeneously
distributed UHECR sources that accelerate nuclei up to a maximal
rigidity, the detection of cosmogenic neutrinos from UHECR nuclei
is out of reach for the next generation detectors. This statementis valid considering model systematics of the propagation and
the air-shower model (Heinze et al. 2019 ). The present modelcaptures some of the variety of observed light curves by scanning
over engine properties. The neutrino ﬂuxes in right-hand panelof Fig. 9, therefore, include some non-trivial scenarios with (for
example) a high-energy proton component at energies higher than in
simple rigidity-dependent sources models. This sub-leading protoncontribution increases with the level of stochasticity in our model, see
Fig.6. Since these protons reach the threshold for CMB interactions,
the cosmogenic neutrino ﬂux is signiﬁcantly enhanced, see van Vliet,Alves Batista & Horandel ( 2019 ) for a detailed discussion. This is
prominently visible in the right-hand panel of Fig. 9that indicates
the possibility to observe a diffuse component from GRB with the
next generation radio detectors.
We notice here that the use of the σ(X
max) in the ﬁt would reduce
those cases in which protons/neutrons reach very high energies in the
escape spectra, with the consequence of suppressing the production
of neutrinos in the extragalactic space. In this case, the 3 σrange
of the cosmogenic neutrino ﬂux would be barely detectable with 10
yr of IceCube-Gen2 or GRAND exposure. Since the production of
prompt neutrinos is mostly dependent on the efﬁciency of the in-source interactions and not on the maximum energy of the cosmic
rays, the result on the source neutrino ﬂux is qualitatively not affected
by the use of the σ(X
max)i nt h eﬁ t .

### 5 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

5 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
We have performed a systematic parameter space study of the engine
properties of GRBs in the internal shock scenario in the context of
multimessenger observations. Since neutrino observations are knownto constrain the UHECR origin from GRBs in one-zone models,
our model includes multiple internal shocks, and can describe both
stochastic engines and deterministic ramp-ups over a wide parameterspace. The main target of our study has been the question if long-
duration GRBs can describe UHECR spectrum and composition data
in spite of existing limits from the non-observation of GRB (promptand cosmogenic) neutrinos.

UHECR nuclei in GRB multicollision models 6003
We have demonstrated that UHECR data (spectrum and /angbracketleftXmax/angbracketright)
can indeed be described in a wide range of engine parameters, andthat UHECR data alone cannot discriminate among different options.
The observed σ(X
max), however, indicates a rather pure composition
at the highest energies, which is intrinsically difﬁcult to obtain inmultiregion or population models in which a diversity of production
regions or sources contribute. Here, the superposition of UHECR
emissions from different collision radii results in a larget overlap oflight and heavy masses than observed in data for the majority of the
tested engine parameters. We speculate that either σ(X
max) is more
strongly affected by hadronic uncertainties than anticipated, or thatsigniﬁcant ﬁne-tuning is needed to describe σ(X
max) if GRBs are to
describe the diffuse UHECR ﬂux – otherwise GRBs may not be the
dominant source of the UHECR ﬂux. A similar argument can be madefor other source populations that are dominated by higher redshifts,
unless there is a mechanism to ﬁne-tune the maximal rigidity of each
source. Therefore the trend in σ(X
max) might be better described by
a small population of local sources.
We have ‘post-dicted’ the neutrino ﬂux from the 3 σallowed
region of the UHECR ﬁt, and found that the expected neutrino
ﬂux is well below the current stacking bound in consistency with
earlier estimates from multicollision models. This means that theUHECR paradigm cannot yet be ruled out with neutrino data alone;
we, however, expect that the next generation of neutrino telescopes
could observe GRB neutrinos if GRBs powered the UHECR ﬂux. Ifno neutrinos are observed, especially stochastic engine models will
be effectively constrained with these detectors.
We have also shown that the fraction of nuclei heavier than helium
to be injected at the source has to be larger than 70 per cent (at the
95 per cent CL) in order to describe the UHECR data. This reﬂects
the distribution of isotopes at the end of the core-collapse, which canbe attributed to several different characteristics of the pre-supernova
models.
As possible model discriminators, which are sensitive to the
stochasticity of the engine, the GRB light curves have been identiﬁed.
While these can be easily used for individual GRBs, it may be difﬁcult
to associate them with a whole population of GRBs.
Furthermore, we have demonstrated that the (isotropic-equivalent)
kinetic energy of the outﬂow has to be ∼10
55–1056erg per GRB
implying a low transfer efﬁciency into electromagnetic radiation, ifthe population of long-duration GRBs is powering the UHECRs.
The dissipation efﬁciency problem (transfer from kinetic energy
to non-thermal radiation including baryons) is in that case onlyone part of the problem, the other is how to accelerate baryons
to the highest energies without leaving too much energy below
the UHECR energy. The energy requirement can be somewhatrelaxed for hard (signiﬁcantly harder than E
−2) acceleration spectra,
or an acceleration mechanism with an extremely high transfer
efﬁciency to the highest energies. Nevertheless, this extreme energyrequirement is difﬁcult to circumvent, and may be tested by afterglow
observations.
We conclude that the GRB paradigm for UHECRs cannot be
uniquely excluded at this point. On the one hand, the description
of UHECR data has revealed that spectrum and /angbracketleftX
max/angbracketrightcan in
fact described for a wide range of engine parameters with an
inferred bulk Lorentz factor /similarequal200–400 within expectations, and
the post-dicted prompt and cosmogenic neutrino ﬂuxes are belowcurrent limits without any prior or bias. On the other hand, major
obstacles have been the description of the observed σ(X
max) and the
required energetics. Only independent observations, such as limitsor detections from the next generation of neutrino detectors, will be
able to robustly exclude the GRB-UHECR connection.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
