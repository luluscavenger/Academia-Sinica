## Abstract
The paper explores the hypothesis that cosmic muons, particularly spin-polarized ones, could have induced biological homochirality, a hallmark of life, by affecting the structure of helical biopolymers. The study emphasizes the relative stability of cosmic radiation over geological time, with transient increases due to nearby supernovae or gamma-ray bursts possibly influencing atmospheric conditions and evolutionary pressures on life. Proposed experiments aim to test the interaction between cosmic ray lodacity and molecular chirality by measuring mutation rates in bacteria exposed to spin-polarized radiation. The research highlights that muon radiation predominates at different altitudes on Earth, Mars, Titan, and Venus, suggesting these locations as potential sites for life's origin. Additionally, enantioselective auto-catalysis is discussed as a mechanism for the emergence of homochirality, driven by cosmic radiation. The findings provide insights into how cosmic ray interactions may have been crucial in the early development of life, offering a novel perspective on astrobiology and the origins of homochirality.

## Key Findings
1. Cosmic muons are posited to influence biological homochirality, with spin-polarized muons potentially inducing asymmetries in helical biopolymers, possibly linking cosmic ray interactions to the emergence of life.
2. The average cosmic radiation flux is largely stable over geological time, with variations due to supernovae or gamma-ray bursts, potentially impacting atmospheric properties and life evolution.
3. Experiments are proposed to test the interaction between cosmic ray lodacity and molecular chirality, such as measuring mutation rates in bacteria under spin-polarized radiation.
4. Muon radiation effects are significant at different altitudes on Earth, Mars, Titan, and Venus, with muons dominating at Earth's surface and in Venus' clouds, influencing potential sites for life's origin.
5. Enantioselective auto-catalysis, where molecules of the same chirality catalyze their own production, is a model that can explain the emergence of homochirality under cosmic radiation influence.
