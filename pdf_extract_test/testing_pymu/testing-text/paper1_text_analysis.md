### INTRODUCTION

INTRODUCTION
Neutrino astronomy is flourishing. Its roots run at
least half a century deep, to the 1960s, when high-energy
neutrinos became associated with newly discovered cos-
mic phenomena, such as quasars, stellar collapse, and
the cosmic microwave background. Although plans for a
deep underwater neutrino detector had already formed in
the 1970s [1], exploring the cosmos with neutrinos only
became a reality in 2013, when the IceCube Neutrino Ob-
servatory discovered the first extra-galactic high-energy
neutrinos—of petaelectrovolts (PeV) [2]. The field has
evolved rapidly since.
In the last decade, the study of cosmic neutrinos has
yielded significant insights into their potential sources—
from the Milky Way to active galactic nuclei–and moved
the field closer to finding the long-sought origin of cosmic
rays [3, 4]. It has furthermore enabled some of the most
stringent tests of fundamental physics to date (e.g., Ref.
[5]), along with providing hints of physics beyond theStandard Model [6].
However, despite these successes, there is still a severe
lack of identified cosmic high-energy neutrino sources.
Only three such sources have been identified with high
significance: an active galactic nucleus, an active galaxy,
and the Milky Way [7–9]. The neutrino flux from these
sources makes up only a small fraction of the total ob-
served cosmic neutrino flux, and the origin of most cos-
mic neutrinos hence remains unknown. Additionally,
the discovery of the three known neutrino sources re-
lied on the aid of gamma-ray observations [7, 8]. Neu-
trino sources uncorrelated with electromagnetic radiation
might be abundant, yet searches for them have been un-
successful.
An urgent demand thus exists to develop new tech-
niques to discover neutrino sources more effectively, in
particular ones that are unbiased toward having electro-
magnetic counterparts. Moreover, a push towards low-
cost detectors would make the field more widely acces-
sible, support its growth, and complement the ground-
breaking yet costly efforts of IceCube [2], KM3NeT [10],arXiv:2507.08070v1  [astro-ph.HE]  10 Jul 2025

and Baikal-GVD [11]. Here we introduce TAMBO—the
Tau Air-shower Mountain-Based Observatory—a neu-
trino observatory specifically designed to address these
issues.

### ENTER TAMBO

ENTER TAMBO
TAMBO is designed to overcome the major challenge
in identifying neutrino sources for existing experiments:
the background of atmospheric neutrinos that is roughly
a million times larger than cosmic neutrino signals. Un-
like traditional neutrino telescopes, TAMBO is developed
to be sensitive to higher-energy, supra-PeV tauneutrinos.
At these high energies, the cosmic neutrino signal dom-
inates over the atmospheric neutrino background, par-
ticularly for tau neutrinos. As a result, any neutrino
detected by TAMBO is likely to be of cosmic origin.
The key to TAMBO’s concept is the use of the topog-
raphy of a deep valley (Figure 1). Upon reaching Earth,
high-energy cosmic tau neutrinos ( ντ) can travel for up to
hundreds of kilometers through the Earth’s crust. Each
ντhas a chance to interact with the rock in the crust
and produce a short-lived tau lepton, the probability of
which increases with neutrino energy. If this occurs in
the vicinity of a deep valley, the tau lepton exits intothe air, decays, and initiates an extensive air shower of
particles that cross the expanse of the valley. TAMBO
aims to observe these air showers by placing an array
of particle detectors on one face of the valley, allowing
it to monitor the opposite face and thus detect Earth-
skimming tau neutrinos that reach it from nearly hor-
izontal directions—realizing an idea first introduced in
1999 [12].
TAMBO is set up to determine the direction of tau
neutrinos with sub-degree angular resolution, which is a
crucial requisite to search for neutrino point sources. In
its nominal configuration, TAMBO comprises 5,000 de-
tection units spaced 150 m apart on a triangular grid, to
account for the footprint of a typical particle shower in
a deep valley (i.e., hundreds of meters). From the num-
ber of particles incident on each detection unit and the
times at which different units are hit, TAMBO infers the
neutrino energy and direction. Figure 2 illustrates this
setup and shows the simulated detection of a neutrino
with about 8 PeV of energy.
Figure 3 shows TAMBO’s aperture, which is propor-
tional to its sensitivity to the incoming neutrino flux.
Throughout most of the energy range, the signal primar-
ily originates from ντ-initiated showers. Around 6 .3 PeV,
the signal is dominated by the Glashow resonance of ¯ νe
interacting with electrons, which create W−bosons that
3
decay to tau leptons. Above 2 PeV, the TAMBO aper-
ture exceeds the IceCube ντaperture, which is limited
by the requirement that showers be contained within the
instrumented volume. Above 1 EeV, the TAMBO aper-
ture flattens because the boosted tau lifetime prevents it
from decaying inside the valley.
In its nominal configuration, we expect TAMBO to
observe, on average, 6 extragalactic neutrinos every ten
years, assuming only the neutrino flux measured by Ice-
Cube in Ref. [13], and more than 20 in ten years in more
optimistic scenarios [14]. While the overall number of de-
tected neutrinos may be small compared to observatories
such as IceCube, the cosmic purity of TAMBO’s sam-
ple will be substantially higher: every neutrino detected
by TAMBO will mark the observation of either a cosmic
neutrino source or the discovery of the long-theorized cos-
mogenic neutrino flux. Beyond its own science goals (see
below), TAMBO thus acts as a viewfinder for other neu-
trino telescopes worldwide: providing precise locations of
likely neutrino sources to inspect more closely and over-
coming the statistical penalties that weaken current full-
sky and catalog source searches.
TAMBO furthermore benefits from a relatively low
cost compared with traditional water- or ice-Cherenkov
neutrino telescopes: its detection units are significantly
cheaper and easier to deploy, as they do not require
deep drilling in ice or deployment in the sea. We ex-
pect TAMBO’s final price tag to be around 10% of that
of IceCube. The performance of TAMBO scales with the
number of detection units deployed, and partial goals are
achievable even with a fraction of the array simulated
here, making TAMBO resilient should funding become
limited. Considering how strongly TAMBO will boost
the capabilities of existing neutrino telescopes to study
neutrino sources, we believe it could be their most cost-
effective enhancement.
A key design challenge for TAMBO’s detection concept
is selecting an optimal geographic site that provides the
required surface area and valley width. Several potential
locations for TAMBO are currently under consideration
for their technical, societal, and environmental suitabil-
ity, with one strong possibility being the Colca Valley in
the Peruvian Andes. Because mountain ecosystems are
generally fragile and sites can have potential histories of
foreign exploitation, our collaboration is spearheading a
socially and environmentally responsible approach to the
site selection procedure, inspired by similar discussions
taking place in other areas of astronomy [15].

Discovering new astrophysical neutrino sources—
Below ∼100 PeV, neutrinos observed by TAMBO will
likely originate from inside cosmic accelerators, thus

Each detection unit in the TAMBO array is marked as a dot.
A tau neutrino, with energy Eν, interacts inside the valley
face near the bottom-right corner of the figure and produces
a tau that, upon decaying, initiates a particle shower with
energy Es. Detection units triggered by shower particles are
displayed as colored circles, their size proportional to the num-
ber of detected particles, Nparticle , and their color indicating
the time when the first particle hits the detector. The sim-
ulated array is located in Peru’s Colca Canyon, a candidate
site, with an approximate depth of 1.5 km and a median dis-
tance between valley sides of 4.5 km.
Following an observation by TAMBO, the potential
source location can be promptly investigated by the ex-
isting larger-statistics, lower-purity neutrino telescopes
(IceCube, KM3NeT, BaikalGVD) using their full archival
datasets. This will substantially increase the sensitivity
of these telescopes by reducing the size of the trials fac-
tor, compared to contemporary source-search techniques.
With the lower threshold of these experiments, and given
that the neutrino flux typically falls with neutrino en-
ergy, they will be capable of seeing many events from
the TAMBO-discovered candidate source positions. This
could lead to the first neutrino-only source discovery in
astronomy, without relying on observations using light or
light-based catalogs.
Searching for the diffuse cosmogenic neutrino flux—
Above ∼100 PeV, any neutrinos observed by TAMBO
are more likely to have originated from a diffuse flux
ofcosmogenic neutrinos rather than from cosmic ac-
celerators; these neutrinos are produced by ultra-high-
energy protons scattering off the cosmic microwave back-
ground [16]. As such, TAMBO will provide crucial in-
sights on models of cosmogenic neutrinos, helping to

is estimated by simulating an array of 5000 detection units
spaced 150 m apart at a site in the Colca Canyon. The all-
flavor aperture comprises contributions from neutrino types
that can create a tau decay in the valley, ντ, ¯ντ, and ¯ νevia

only is also presented; the corresponding IceCube acceptance
is shown for comparison.
explain the dearth of cosmic rays with energies above
the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin limit, 5 ×1019eV [17, 18].
Our forecasts show that, after seven years of operation,
TAMBO will be sensitive to optimistic cosmogenic neu-
trino flux models, such as that proposed by Bergman
& van Vliet [19]. This sensitivity will also enable cru-
cial new insight into KM3NeT’s recent 220 PeV neutrino
observation. The origin of this neutrino is currently un-
known [20], and combined analyses with IceCube data
have so far been inconclusive [21].
In addition to searching for the cosmogenic neutrino
flux, TAMBO will expand upon IceCube’s measure-
ments [22] of the diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux,
thought to originate from unresolved point sources.
TAMBO extends these measurements above several PeV:
between 1 PeV and 1 EeV, its projected sensitivity to this
diffuse astrophysical flux exceeds that of all present-day
observatories.

### MESSENGERS OF UNCHARTED PHYSICS

MESSENGERS OF UNCHARTED PHYSICS
Searching for new particle phenomena— In just over a
decade, neutrino astrophysics has provided a wealth of
tests of the Standard Model. Such tests include mea-
suring the neutrino-nucleon cross section [23], probing
neutrino interactions with dark matter [24], searching for
sterile neutrinos [25], scrutinizing different neutrino mass
mechanisms [26], testing fundamental symmetries [27],
and setting limits on quantum gravity [28]. Despite this
broad program, the strength of such tests degrades at
≳PeV energies due to the dearth of neutrinos detectedat these energies.
TAMBO will extend these tests to energies above a few
PeV while also enabling new tests of physics beyond the
Standard Model by taking advantage of its ντexclusiv-
ity. The ντis the least-observed Standard Model particle,
and thus there are considerable opportunities to discover
or constrain new physics associated with it. Of particu-
lar interest is TAMBO’s ability to further constrain the
cosmic neutrino flux’s flavor composition by combining
its data with that of IceCube. Because the flavor compo-
sition is a particularly versatile probe of new physics [29],
such a measurement would inform multiple new-physics
models.
Understanding hadronic models and cosmic-ray
physics— Because of its location in a valley, TAMBO
will also uniquely contribute to understanding cosmic
rays and their associated air showers, complementing
existing experiments such as IceTop [30] and the Pierre
Auger Observatory [31].
In particular, TAMBO has significant potential to ad-
dress the cosmic-ray muon puzzle : the persistent un-
derprediction of the average number of muons by air-
shower simulations, despite correctly predicting other
shower properties [32]. Leveraging its high-altitude loca-
tion, inclined geometry, and natural geological features,
TAMBO could utilize surrounding rock formations to
selectively shield the electromagnetic component of air
showers. This approach would enable simultaneous mea-
surements of electromagnetic and muonic components,
offering a new perspective on air shower physics at en-
ergies where discrepancies in muon predictions become
evident. Resolving the muon puzzle will directly impact
neutrino astronomy: the same hadronic models thought
to give rise to the muon puzzle are also used to predict
part of the atmospheric neutrino flux, a key background
in traditional neutrino observatories.
TAMBO’s sensitivity to neutrino messengers in the
PeV to EeV energy range will help map the neutrino sky,
search for of new physics, and unlock the door to a new
era of neutrino astronomy—moving the field from deep
ice and deep waters into the deep valley. In Quechua,
the indigenous language spoken in the Andean moun-
tains, tambo means “inn”: it was the name of a building
in the Inca empire used as a resting place for messen-
gers traversing the mountains. The TAMBO experiment
echoes this; it will be a home for cosmic neutrino messen-
gers that bring news from the highest-energy phenomena
in the Universe.
