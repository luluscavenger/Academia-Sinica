## Abstract
Chromo is a high-performance Python interface for hadronic event generators, including EPOS, DPMJet, Sibyll, QGSJet, and Pythia, designed for collider and cosmic-ray simulations. Built on their Fortran and C++ implementations, Chromo provides a zero-overhead abstraction layer that preserves performance while offering a unified API for simulation, analysis, and event export in formats such as HepMC, ROOT, and SVG. Easily installable via PyPI, Chromo integrates with the Scientific Python ecosystem, enabling interactive and scripted use in Python and Jupyter. It supports seamless model comparison and parameter scans, lowering the barrier to entry for new users. Chromo's performance matches or exceeds traditional tools like CRMC, validated by over 2,000 unit tests across platforms. With a focus on reducing fragmentation in event generator interfaces and data formats, Chromo facilitates standardized handling of setup, generation, filtering, and export, ensuring reproducibility and cross-platform stability.

## Key Findings
1. Chromo acts as a Python interface for hadronic event generators such as EPOS, DPMJet, Sibyll, QGSJet, and Pythia, maintaining high performance through zero-overhead bindings.
2. It provides a unified API for simulation and analysis, supporting event export in formats like HepMC, ROOT, and SVG, while integrating seamlessly with the Scientific Python ecosystem.
3. Chromo simplifies model comparison and parameter scans by allowing users to switch between different event generators without reinitializing, enhancing ease of use.
4. The package offers advanced features like particle filtering, event serialization, and visualization, reducing the barrier to entry for new users via easy installation through PyPI.
5. Chromo's performance matches or exceeds traditional tools like CRMC, validated through extensive testing with over 2,000 unit tests ensuring cross-platform consistency and reproducibility.
